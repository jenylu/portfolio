         from Beatrice Blue's Childhood Week challenge. It's based on my own memory of having
         to learn how to high dive the first time. I learned more about perspective and composition 
         as well as how to use Procreate at this point compared to the first 
         time I drew it and I think the result shows.`,

        description: `I made this piece as part of a 4 day Warrior Art course I took
         called Painting Festive Scenes with Gloria FÃ©lix. We each picked two festivals we wanted
         to illustrate that took place during the day and night. I picked the Chinese holiday
         Dragonboat Festival for my day scene. This is a holiday that consists of teams racing
         each other in dragonboats including a drummer at the front to keep the pace and guide. 
         We went through the process of research to thumbnails and composition to color roughs to shadow to 
         final line and color.`,

         Illustration Contest. The theme was to "capture the essence of the golden season where
         we hold the Oktoberfest conference, our beloved SF & North Bay geographical region,
         with a delightful nod to the world of books". Other requirements included the size 
         8.5" x 11" and room for a title as well as a signature at the bottom. Using the theme given, 
         I brainstormed some ideas that would fit and came up with this piece. I also used it for
         a promo postcard.`,

         is clearly taking over the bears' home and how it seems to be Baby Bear that is 
         suffering the most... And this is what I came up with. Would you read this book?`,

       before and mainly focused on oranges and blues. It forced me to rely a lot more on 
       value as well. There's some behind the scenes with how I made these reference photos

         Dragonboat Festival for my day scene. This is a holiday that consists of teams racing
         each other in dragonboats including a drummer at the front to keep the pace and guide. 
         We went through the process of research to thumbnails and composition to color roughs to shadow to 
         final line and color.`,

            environments that inspire us as reference. Sometimes a photo doesn't capture
            all of the feelings we have in that moment and we can use art to do that. I
            was particularly inspired by this magical front yard I had sketched while doing a 
            stairway walk around SF. I had also recently visited SLO and our Airbnb had
            the cutest sleepy old dog in another very magical garden. I knew I wanted to 
            draw these two things and this was the result.`,

        art for your Joy. Let the energy of San Francisco, the North and East Bay, and 
        your inner world shine through!" I was inspired by the 16th Avenue Tiles Steps
        in San Francisco and the beautiful mosaic art. I really enjoy city walks and sketching
        along the way. It's a big source of inspiration for myself so I decided to choose
        these steps as part of the art. I went back and took reference photos of myself and
        did some rough sketches while I was there.`,

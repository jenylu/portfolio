        definition of girlhood and living out all our high school dreams together. I had
        such a magical time and wanted to capture that memory. The Celestial Ball tied the
        whole trip together and it was especially funny that it was practically 90% women.
        Turns out a lot of regency dance includes skipping in a circle and that just felt
        even more like living out my childhood dreams. I hope those feelings come through.`,

         Dragonboat Festival for my day scene. This is a holiday that consists of teams racing
         each other in dragonboats including a drummer at the front to keep the pace and guide.

            all of the feelings we have in that moment and we can use art to do that. I
            was particularly inspired by this magical front yard I had sketched while doing a 
            stairway walk around SF. I had also recently visited SLO and our Airbnb had
            the cutest sleepy old dog in another very magical garden. I knew I wanted to

        art for your Joy. Let the energy of San Francisco, the North and East Bay, and 
        your inner world shine through!" I was inspired by the 16th Avenue Tiles Steps
        in San Francisco and the beautiful mosaic art. I really enjoy city walks and sketching
        along the way. It's a big source of inspiration for myself so I decided to choose
        these steps as part of the art. I went back and took reference photos of myself and
        did some rough sketches while I was there.`,
